inline int max(int a,int b)
{
return (a>b)?a:b;
}
int main()
{
int a,b;
cin>>a>>b;
int c= max(a,b);
}


here if the function wasnt inline then copy of a,b would have been formed
in the function.
So to avoid this we make the function inline
Now during compilation when the compiler sees the function call
it copies the function definition there and no copy variables have to be formed

inline functions are used when the function definition is not
long and is usually of one line only.
